	<h2>10 facts about national parks</h2>

	<dl>
	  

	  <dt>Half Dome in Yosemite</dt>

	  <dd class="important invisible">Like all good landmarks, Half Dome is an eye magnet</dd>

	  <dt>Mount McKinley in Denali</dt>

	  <dd class="important invisible">The mountain sprawls across the Alaska tundra like half a planet, gleaming white and broad shouldered. </dd>

	  <dt>Grand Teton and the Central Peaks</dt>

	  <dd class="important invisible">Grand Teton, the central crag of the Teton Range, scrapes the clouds nearly 7,000 feet above the Wyoming valley floor</dd>

	  <dt>Mount Rainier</dt>
	  
	  <dd class="important invisible">Now you see it, now you don’t. Mount Rainier, true to its name, disappears behind cloud banks, stays hidden for days and weeks at a time, and reappears in most dramatic fashion</dd>

	  <dt>Cumberland Gap National Historical Park</dt>
	  
	  <dd class="important invisible">This landmark is the opposite of a high prominence, but to American immigrants in the late 1700s, it was an extremely important geographic feature.</dd>

	  <dt>Chimney Rock National Historic Site</dt>

	  <dd class="important invisible">From the relatively flat surrounding land, the treestump-like tower’s sides form smooth upward arcs, drawing our thoughts to the sk</dd>

	  <dt> Island in the Sky in Canyonlands</dt>
	  
	  <dd class="important invisible">The opposite pleasure is to get far above it all, up in the wind and weather, where the view is limited only by the arc of the Earth. </dd>

	  <dt> Bering Land Bridge National Preserve</dt>
	  
	  <dd class="important invisible">Sea level fell when Ice Age glaciers took up vast quantities of water and rose when those glaciers melted. </dd>

	  <dt>Cape Royal and Angels Window in Grand Canyon</dt>

	  <dd class="important invisible">Angels don’t need windows, but if they ever wanted to frame a great view, they might choose the North Rim’s Cape Royal (above) and its noble companion parapet in Arizona.</dd>
